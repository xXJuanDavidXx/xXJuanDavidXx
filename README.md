- **Problem Solver**: I'm very good at researching and troubleshooting issues, and I enjoy the process of debugging and finding solutions.
- **Web Development**: I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While my focus is on the backend, I know enough to create complete web applications by myself.
